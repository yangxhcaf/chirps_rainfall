### Extract daily CHIRPS rainfall data for a particular region/point
### Yujun Zhou, Nov 26. 2018 


Code for automatic downloading, extracting and processing CHIRPS rainfall data at ease! 


Processing code can be applied to other types of geospatial data in raster or netcdf formats. 


To extract netCDF (.nc) files (point data and much faster), see ExtractNC folder for application with Africa rainfall and temperature data and with global CHIRPS data

To extract TIF data (raster data), see ExtractTIF folder for application to extract daily, monthly rainfall averaged at the district/cluster/cropland level.  




Data are not stored in this repository due to size limit, but CHIRPS rainfall data is publically avaliable at  ftp://ftp.chg.ucsb.edu/pub/org/chg/products/CHIRPS-2.0
